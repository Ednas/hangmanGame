# hangmanGame

## Background
Welcome to Fruity hangman. I worked with my kids on this and we had so much fun. This game was born out of an assignment in my coding bootcamp class back in 2016, my kids were 10 at the time. I had started this game on my own, then decided in order to teach them about JavaScript and to help me get the material to stick a little bit better, to have them help me. It started with us creating new arrays together of various fruits, finding problems with the game (we could not get the button click event to work on the iPhone), solving those problems, finding new problems, etc.
This has been my fondest project to date, mainly because I got to share my knowledge with my kids and build something that was fun for them.


## About the game itself
This game started as a keyboard click event game and now we have dynamically created buttons which become disabled once you click them so that you don't choose the same letter more than once.

There is a large array of various fruits, you may not be familiar with some of them, there are exotics in the list.

If you get a high score (higher than 10 wins), tweet me at @ednas and tell me about it!
